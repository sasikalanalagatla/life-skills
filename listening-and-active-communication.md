# Listening and Active Communication

## 1. Active Listening

**Question 1: What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)**

1. **Pay Full Attention** – Focus completely on the speaker without distractions (no phones, side conversations, or multitasking). This shows respect and helps you fully understand the message.
2. **Show That You’re Listening** – Use body language like nodding, eye contact, and facial expressions to indicate interest.
3. **Provide Feedback** – Paraphrase or summarize what the speaker said to confirm understanding and encourage clarity.
4. **Defer Judgment** – Avoid interrupting or mentally preparing your response while the other person is still talking.
5. **Respond Appropriately** – Reply in a respectful and constructive way to show that you value the speaker’s input.
6. **Ask Clarifying Questions** – If something is unclear, ask for more details to ensure complete understanding.


## 2. Reflective Listening

**Question 2: According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?**

- Listen carefully to both what the person is saying and how they feel.
- Say the message back in your own words to check if you understood correctly.
- Notice how they speak—their tone, expressions, and body language.
- Stay calm and don’t judge, even if the topic is emotional or difficult.
- Show that you understand their feelings by being respectful and kind.
- Helps avoid confusion and makes sure everyone understands each other, which is very important in serious or professional conversations.

## 3. Reflection

**Question 3: What are the obstacles in your listening process?**

- I get distracted by my phone, background noise, or things happening around me, which takes my attention away from the speaker.  
- I often start preparing my response before the person has finished talking, so I miss important parts of what they’re saying.  
- Sometimes, I assume I know what the other person will say and stop fully paying attention.  
- During long or complex conversations (like technical discussions or long meetings), I tend to zone out or lose track of the conversation.  
- My emotions—like frustration, boredom, or anxiety—sometimes get in the way and stop me from listening with an open mind.  

**Extra Thoughts:**  
- I also realize that if I’m multitasking (like writing or reading something else), I don’t listen actively.  
- If the topic doesn’t interest me much, I struggle to stay engaged, even if it’s important.

**Question 4: What can you do to improve your listening?**

- I will try to keep my phone on silent or away when someone is talking to avoid getting distracted.  
- I’ll make a conscious effort to wait until the speaker finishes before I think about what to say in return.  
- I will repeat or summarize what I heard to confirm that I understood it correctly.  
- I’ll take short notes during important or technical conversations to help me remember the details.  
- I will practice being more emotionally aware and stay calm and present during conversations.  

**Additional Strategies:**  
- I can ask questions to clarify if something is unclear instead of guessing or assuming.  
- I’ll try to give visual cues like nodding or saying “I see” to show the speaker that I’m paying attention.  
- I’ll give full attention especially when someone is sharing something personal or sensitive.  


## 4. Types of Communication

### Passive Communication  
**Question 5: When do you switch to passive communication in your daily life?**

- When I feel shy or unsure about what to say  
- When I want to avoid arguments or problems  
- When I think others won’t value my opinion  
- When I feel less experienced or less knowledgeable than others  
- In new groups where I don’t know people well  

**How it affects me:**  
- I don’t share my thoughts, even if they are important  
- People may not take me seriously  
- I feel ignored or dissatisfied after the conversation  


### Aggressive Communication  

**Question 6: When do you switch to aggressive communication in your daily life?**

- When I get really frustrated or feel unheard  
- When I’m under pressure and things aren't going right  
- When I feel the need to take control fast  
- When someone challenges me or my ideas strongly  
- When I feel like someone is being unfair to me or someone else  

**How it affects me and others:**  
- I might hurt someone’s feelings without meaning to  
- The conversation becomes one-sided or argumentative  
- People might avoid talking to me later  


### Passive-Aggressive Communication  

**Question 7: When do you use passive-aggressive communication in your daily life?**

- When I’m upset but don’t want to say it directly  
- When I feel someone is ignoring me  
- When I express my feelings through sarcasm or giving the silent treatment instead of speaking clearly  
- When I feel stuck and can't say "no" but still want to show I’m unhappy  
- When I gossip or make jokes that hide how I really feel  

**How it affects me and others:**  
- The real issue never gets solved  
- It can confuse or annoy others  
- It builds tension over time instead of fixing problems  


### Assertive Communication  

**Question 8: How can you make your communication more assertive?**

- Speak clearly and calmly, without being rude  
- Use “I” statements to talk about your feelings (e.g., “I feel left out when I’m not informed”)  
- Respect your needs and the other person’s needs too  
- Listen first, then respond thoughtfully  
- Practice saying what you mean with confidence  
- Watch and learn from examples in videos or real-life situations to improve  
- Ask for feedback on how you speak and try to improve  
- Keep practicing in small situations like giving your opinion in group discussions or saying “no” politely  

**Why assertiveness helps:**  
- Builds better relationships based on respect  
- You express yourself clearly without hurting others  
- People are more likely to listen and respond positively  
- It improves your confidence and reduces stress in communication
