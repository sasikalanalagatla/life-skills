# 📘 Prevention of Sexual Harassment — Q&A

## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes a wide range of **unwelcome**, **sex-based behaviors** that create an offensive, hostile, or intimidating environment. These behaviors may be verbal, non-verbal, physical, written, or digital.

### ✅ Common Examples:
- Unwelcome sexual advances, flirting, or propositions  
- Requests for sexual favors in exchange for workplace benefits (quid pro quo)  
- Inappropriate comments, jokes, gestures, or lewd noises related to sex or gender  
- Sharing or displaying explicit images, content, or sexual materials  
- Persistent questions or discussions about one’s sex life or private sexual preferences  
- Catcalling, wolf-whistling, leering, or suggestive staring  
- Unwanted touching, hugging, cornering, or brushing against someone  
- Sending unsolicited sexual texts, emails, or online messages  
- Spreading sexual rumors or gossip  
- Stalking, indecent exposure, or entrapment  
- Repeated invitations after someone declines  
- Offensive behavior based on gender stereotypes or sexist slurs

## 2. What would you do if you face or witness such behaviour?

### A. If **you face harassment**:
1. **Express non-consent clearly** — tell the person firmly and respectfully that their behavior is unwanted.  
2. **Document everything** — save messages, notes, dates, names of witnesses, etc.  
3. **Report promptly** — follow your organization’s PoSH/HR policy (e.g., contact the Internal Committee, HR, or a designated officer).  
4. **Seek trusted support** — confide in colleagues, friends, or mentors for emotional support.  
5. **Escalate if needed** — if the internal response isn’t effective, use external channels, such as a PoSH committee, legal authorities, or helplines.

### B. If you **witness harassment**:
1. **Intervene safely** — e.g., distract, deflect the attention, or question the harasser politely.  
2. **Support the target** — ask if they’re okay and offer your help.  
3. **Document the incident** — record date, time, setting, people present, and what happened.  
4. **Report through proper channels**, even if you're not the direct target.  
5. **Follow up** — check on the victim well-being and ensure they know they’re not alone.
