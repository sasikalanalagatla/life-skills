# Tiny Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

**Most interesting story or idea:**
The most interesting idea was how BJ Fogg encourages starting with _tiny_ versions of habits—like just flossing one tooth—to make them easier to start and maintain. His story about how small habits lead to big changes over time was really eye-opening.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message

**B = MAP Explanation:**
B = Behavior, M = Motivation, A = Ability, P = Prompt. This means a behavior happens when motivation, ability, and prompt come together. To make habits easier, reduce the need for high motivation by increasing ability and ensuring a clear prompt or trigger.

**Importance of Celebrating:**
Celebrating makes your brain associate the new habit with positive emotions, reinforcing it. This emotional reinforcement helps habits stick faster, which is why BJ Fogg says, “Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.”

## 3. 1% Better Every Day Video

**Most interesting story or idea:**
The idea that getting just 1% better every day leads to huge improvements over time stood out. The story of British cycling’s transformation by focusing on marginal gains—tiny improvements in all areas—was particularly inspiring.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

**Book’s perspective about Identity:**
Atomic Habits emphasizes that habits are tied to identity. Instead of saying “I want to read more,” you say “I am a reader.” Your habits should reflect who you want to become. This identity-based habit formation makes them more sustainable.

**Making a habit easier to do:**
The book recommends reducing friction—make the habit simple and accessible. For example, if you want to work out, keep your gym clothes ready. Use the two-minute rule: start with a version that takes two minutes to do.

**Making a habit harder to do:**
To break a bad habit, increase friction. Make it less convenient—like deleting social media apps or putting junk food out of sight. The harder it is to perform, the less likely you are to repeat it.

## 5. Reflection

**Habit to do more of:**
I want to read more regularly. To do this, I’ll:

- Keep a book on my desk (obvious cue)
- Read for just 2 minutes after breakfast (easy and anchored to an existing routine)
- Mark it off on a calendar (satisfying response)

**Habit to eliminate:**
I want to reduce checking my phone first thing in the morning. I’ll:

- Keep my phone in another room at night (remove cue)
- Use an alarm clock instead (make the process harder)
- Reflect on how much calmer my mornings are without it (unsatisfying response when I fail)
