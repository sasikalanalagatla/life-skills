## Question 3: What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

- **Active mode**: This is when your brain is fully focused on a task, like solving a math problem or studying. 
You use this mode when you are concentrating hard and thinking step-by-step.

- **Diffused mode**: This is a relaxed state of thinking, like when you're walking, showering, or daydreaming. 
It helps your brain make creative connections and understand ideas in a broader way.

Both modes are important — active mode helps you work through details, and diffused mode helps you see the bigger
picture.
